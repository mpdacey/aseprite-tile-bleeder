# aseprite-tile-bleeder
 This small script for Aseprite that allows you to bleed pixels from a tile set into the padding space that surrounds the pixels. It is very quick and easy to bleed your tile sets so that they will not cause horrible seams in UVs or Unity tilemaps.

 If you wish to contribute to this small tool, then by all means, please fork this repository and play around with the plugin, then great a pull request if you wish to make an official extension that is free to use for all other developers or artists in need.
